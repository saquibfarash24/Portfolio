  ABOUT ME
</h1>

      <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 text-justify leading-relaxed">
        I'm a passionate full-stack developer with hands-on experience in both the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stacks. I specialize in building dynamic, high-performance web applications with clean, scalable code. From designing intuitive user interfaces with React to managing robust databases with MongoDB and PostgreSQL, I enjoy working across the entire development lifecycle.
        <br /><br />
        My proficiency in backend logic, RESTful APIs, and state management enables me to develop full-featured applications efficiently. In addition to JavaScript frameworks, I also have a solid foundation in Java, which strengthens my object-oriented programming and backend development skills.
        <br /><br />
        I value collaboration, clean code, and continuous learning, and I'm always looking to push my skills further. Whether itâ€™s deploying full-stack apps, optimizing database performance, or integrating APIs, I bring dedication and problem-solving to every project I take on.
